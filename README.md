# What happens when ... Kubernetes

Imagine I want to run nginx in a Kubernetes cluster and make it visible to the outside world. We can do this in a one-liner with kubectl:

```bash
kubectl run --image=nginx --replicas=3 --port=80 --expose
```

But what _really_ happens when you run that command?

One of the beautiful things about Kubernetes is that it offers tremendous power while abstracting complexity through user-friendly interfaces. In order to understand this complexity (and therefore what value Kubernetes offers us), we need to follow the path of a request as it travels through a Kubernetes sytem. This repo seeks to explain that lifecycle.
