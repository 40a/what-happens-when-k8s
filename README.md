# What happens when ... Kubernetes

Imagine I want to run nginx in a Kubernetes cluster and make it visible to the outside world. We can do this in a one-liner with kubectl:

```bash
kubectl run --image=nginx --replicas=3 --port=80 --expose
```

But what _really_ happens when you run that command?

One of the beautiful things about Kubernetes is that it offers tremendous power while abstracting complexity through user-friendly interfaces. In order to understand this complexity (and therefore what value Kubernetes offers us), we need to follow the path of a request as it travels through a Kubernetes sytem. This repo seeks to explain that lifecycle.

This is a living document. Contributions that add, edit, or delete content where necessary is definitely welcome!

## api version reconciliation

kubectl uses client-go's discovery client to retrieve all API groups, saving this list to a file in ~/.kube/schema. It then retrieves supported versions for those groups and saves to ~. This is a cached representation of the remote server API in its current form and allows kubectl to handle some client-side validation. 

## kubectl generates objects

since the `run` command can actually deploy multiple resource types, kubectl will try to infer what type of resource to run if it wasn't explicitly specified with the `--generator` flag. For example, resources that have `--restart-policy=Always` are considered Deployments, those with `--restart-policy=Never` are considered pods. 

it also determines other actions, e.g. whether to record the command, or whether this command is just a dry run. if not, it send maps this resource to a specific group and version, then sends it to the API

if an `--expose` flag is provided, it also generates a service object to send to the API.

## creds

kubectl will now try to identify the best location to find your credentials. it follows the following algorithm:

- if a path is specified as a flag, use that
- otherwise $KUBECONFIG
- otherwise look in a predictable home dir location, and use the first file found

it then determines the current context, then the cluster to point to, and auth information. command flags take precedence over those defined in kubeconfig.

objects are sent to the API with the necessary auth information encoded into the HTTP request. for the following auth types:

- x509 certificates are sent using golang's tlsconfig
- bearer tokens are sent with the "Authorization" header
- the openid auth process is handled manually by the operator beforehand, producing a token which is sent like a bearer token

if TLS is enabled, the api server's root CA cert is also sent in the request.

## authentication

when the api server receives the request, it performs authentication to verify the request is from a user or service account it recognizes.
